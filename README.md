# Hall-areas
Elements of the shuffle algebra can be interpreted as "sensors", i.e. as functions from paths to real valued paths. This repo contains python code to perform computations with (Hall) integrals and (Hall) areas, which are elements of the shuffle algebra. The main goal is to prove the conjecture that Hall areas freely generate the shuffle algebra.
